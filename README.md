# Zyfra

**Zyfra** is a *privacy-first Web3 intelligence layer* designed to crowdsource, validate, and distribute financial intelligence for the new economy.

We believe the most valuable financial data doesn’t come from a single institution, but from collective insight. Zyfra empowers communities to contribute intelligence, preserve privacy, and earn fair incentives.
